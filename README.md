# True Source extension

Many articles about studies link to the study or other articles about that study. We should be able to crawl sites based on this link to find the original study be discussed. This extension is an attempt at doing this.

## Installation

Download the `source.zip` file (<a href="https://github.com/mknepprath/true-source/raw/master/source.zip" download>download link</a>) from this repo. Then, in Chrome, do the following:

1. Click the Settings icon - the three dots at the top right.
1. Select More Tools > Extensions.
1. Turn on Developer Mode at the top right.
1. A "Load Unpacked" button should appear at the top left. Click this and select the zip you downloaded.

## Features

- Detects the source link, which is normally located at the bottom of each article.
- Does some stuff with that.
